# The-Founders---Browsergame
The Founders is a lightweight, Settlers II-inspired browser city-builder. Chain productions (woodcutter→sawmill, farm→fields→mill→bakery, mines→smelters), survey mountains with geologists, expand territory with garrisoned towers/castles, and capture the enemy HQ. Runs on vanilla HTML/CSS/JS—just open index.html.
